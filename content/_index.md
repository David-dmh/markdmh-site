# Production-Ready Data Ingestion in Azure

A **clean, fixed-scope ingestion pipeline built in Azure Databricks** — delivered quickly and handed over to your team.

If your team needs data flowing reliably into Azure but doesn’t have time to build it properly, this service is designed to solve that.

No retainers.  
No long-term commitments.  
Just a defined build delivered cleanly.

- You’re already using Azure and Databricks

- Databricks ingestion pipeline structured using best practices  
- Processing and transformation logic where required  
- Data landed into your Azure destination  
- A scheduled or on-demand Databricks job

### Optional Entry Offer (Recommended)

## Databricks Ingestion Review (£300)

If you’re unsure what needs building, I offer a **short architecture review**:

- 90-minute review session  
- Written findings and recommendations  
- Clear next steps  
- No obligation to proceed  

This often clarifies whether a build is needed and can convert into a full pipeline project.
