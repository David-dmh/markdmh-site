I build **production-ready Databricks ingestion pipelines on Azure** for early-stage teams.  

These projects are **small, focused, and fixed-scope**, designed to deliver functional results quickly, without long-term commitments or ongoing maintenance.

### What I do
- Build a single ingestion pipeline from a source system to sink
- Use **Databricks on Azure**  
- Deliver code and basic documentation within a defined timeline

### What I don’t do
- Ongoing support or retainers  
- Performance or cost optimisation guarantees  
- Work in regulated financial services environments

If you need a **straightforward pipeline built cleanly and handed over**, this service may be a good fit.
