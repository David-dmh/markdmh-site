DMH Consulting builds **production-ready Databricks ingestion pipelines on Azure** for early-stage teams.

The work is **small, focused, and fixed-scope**, designed to deliver a working pipeline quickly — without long-term commitments or ongoing maintenance.

### What I do
- Build a single ingestion pipeline from a source system to a defined sink
- Use **Databricks on Azure**
- Deliver code and basic documentation within a defined timeline

### What I don’t do
- Ongoing support or retainers
- Performance or cost optimisation guarantees
- Work in regulated financial services environments

If you need a **straightforward pipeline built cleanly and handed over**, this service may be a good fit.

The work is delivered directly by me, David Herbert, operating as **DMH Consulting**.
