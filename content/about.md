I’m a data engineer based in Scotland, specialising in building data pipelines and platforms on Azure.  

Outside of my primary work, I occasionally take on **small, focused pipeline projects** for early-stage teams. These projects are designed to deliver clear, functional results quickly, without long-term commitments or ongoing maintenance.

This site describes that service offering in a simple, transparent way.
